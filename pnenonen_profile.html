            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p> My name is Parker Nenonen.  I am a senior student and Bradley University who is finishing up
                a CIS (Computer Information Systems) major, with a minor in Ethics.  My career interests are in
                cyber and data security.  I am set to graduate in the winter of 2021.
            </p>

            <h3>My History</h3>
            <p>
                I was born and raised in St. Louis, Missouri.  I am the oldest brother of two kids.
                If you are like any other "St. Louisan", you would probably like to know that I went to
                highschool at Parkway West High School (for those out of the loop, it's a question that
                is asked incredibly often for whatever reason, and a bit of an inside joke).  
            </p>
            
            <h3>Personal Interests</h3>
            <p>
                Part of the reason I chose my major is my love for all things in the technology world.
                This includes personal interests in GNU/Linux operating systems and advocacy for privacy in the
                digital world.

            </p>

            <p>
                I am also a big fan of reading.  Below I have listed some books that I have read and 
                enjoyed recently.
                <ul>
                    <li><i>The Demon in the Freezer</i> by Richard Preston</li>
                    <li><i>11/22/63</i> by Stephen King</li>
                    <li><i>11/22/63</i> by Stephen King</li>
